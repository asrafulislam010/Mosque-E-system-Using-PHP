      <h4 class="mt-5 fw-bolder">History of Shab-e-Meraj </h4>
      <p class="mt-3">Shab-e-Miraj or The Night of Ascent is one of the most celebrated dates of the Islamic calendar. Also known as Lailat al Miraj and Isra and Miraj, Shab-e-Miraj is a holy night that comes on the 27th day of the month of Rajab, the seventh month of the Islamic calendar. The event is observed by Muslims across the world ahead of the holy month of Ramzan or Ramadan. We will give you more detail about the date, history and significance of this holy night.</p>
      <p class="mt-3">Shab-e-Miraj marks the journey of prophet Mohammad from Mecca to what the Quran describes as "the farthest mosque in Jerusalem" where he ascended to heaven. Isra and Miraj are two parts of the "holy" journey.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-5 fw-bolder">Tradition Shab-e-Meraj </h4>
      <p class="mt-3">Muslims spend the day visiting the mosque or reading the story of Isra and Mi’raj at home. Elders Muslims may spend the day with their children and grandchildren to explain Mohammad’s life story to them.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-5 fw-bolder">Significance of Shab-e-Meraj </h4>
      <p class="mt-3">According to Islamic scriptures, on the 27th day of the month of Rajab, prophet Mohammed was visited by two angles. A creature called Buraq then took him to "the farthest mosque in Jerusalem", believed to be the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. His journey from Mecca to Jerusalem is called Isra.</p>
      <p class="mt-3">At the mosque, prophet Mohammad is said to have led the other prophets in prayer. He then ascended to heaven where he spoke to Allah. His subsequent ascent into the heavens came to be known as the Miraj. During this meeting, five-time namaz daily was made mandatory for Muslims.</p>
