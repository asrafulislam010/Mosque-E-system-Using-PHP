          <p class="mt-2">Bitul Mamur Jame Majid is the first purpose-built Mosque in the Mohorkaya. The building work started in 2008. The Mosque has been built with the donations of time and money by the Muslim community of Southampton with the land upon which it is built having been sold to the Muslim community by the local authorities. The Mosque first opened its doors to the public in 2008. It is one of the most recognized and noticeable religious buildings in the city of Lalpur. </p>
          <p class="mt-2">BMJM is a mosaic of determination, resilience, cooperation, and collaboration of Muslims and non-Muslims in Edmonton. Itâ€™s a building not only made of mortar and bricks, but a symbol of peace for all people of all faiths to assemble and to pray. Today, it stands as a majestic reminder of what can be done when a group of like-minded individuals set a goal and work hard to achieve it in the name of Allah.</p>
          <p class="mt-2">BMJM was opened on December 12, 2008. The ceremony was attended by prominent members of the community. The Mosque served as a religious and community center for the Muslim community and as a result, many Muslim families were attracted to Edmonton. The Mosque provided the new Edmonton residents with the reassurance that they could maintain their cultural practices and religious beliefs while interacting with all of cultures and faiths.
