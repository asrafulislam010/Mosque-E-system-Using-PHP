      <h4 class="mt-5 fw-bolder">History of Shab-e-Qadr </h4>
      <p class="mt-3">The night of Shab-e-Qadr, the Night of Decree in Ramadan, is of great significance. The first verses of the Holy Quran were revealed to Prophet Muhammad on this divine night. Angels descend in this night. This night is believed to be much better than a thousand months.</p>
      <p class="mt-3">Shab-e-Qadr also known as Laylat-al-Qadr falls in the final 10 days of Ramadan. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) advised Muslims to "Look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan." (Bukhari).  However, it is typically believed to fall on the 27th night.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-5 fw-bolder">Tradition Shab-e-Qadr </h4>
      <p class="mt-3">Those Muslims who observe this night do so with special prayers, fasting and rituals like staying up for most of the night, usually taking short breaks and praying to Allah and reciting the Quran until dawn. Muslims also have a tradition of visiting mosques and graveyards on this day.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-5 fw-bolder">Significance of Shab-e-Qadr </h4>
      <p class="mt-3">According to a hadith, “Doubtlessly, Allah surrounds everything on the fifteenth night of Sha’aban with his mercy. He forgives all of His creatures except mushriks (polytheists) and those whose hearts are full of hatred or enmity of others...” (Al-Targhib wa al-Tarhib, 2:118).</p>
      <p class="mt-3">Another hadith classed Hassan by Albani in his silsilah Al-Sahihah says, “Allah looks at His creation during the night of the 15th of Sha’aban and He forgives His servants except two- one intent on hatred (mushanin) and a murderer (qatilu nafs).”
      Also reported by Tabrani and Al Bayhaqi, “The Prophet said: ‘On the middle night of Shaban, Allah most high descends to the lowest heaven and remits more sins than the hair of the goats of Banu Kalb.’”</p>
