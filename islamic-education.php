      <p class="mt-3">Masjid based child and mass education program is one of the biggest and important projects of Islamic Foundation. In 1993 in order to involve the imams in the socio-economic developmental activities and for the spreading of education, the government launched masjid-based education program for imparting education to the pre-primary children, dropped-out adolescents and illiterate aged people under the project of masjid-based education. In this project the imams of masajid teach the children and adult learners Bengali, math, English, Arabic, morality, ethics etc. at the masjid-centers. Most of the beneficiaries of this project are underprivileged, poor and illiterate population. The present article by reviewing the masjid-based child and mass education program of Islamic Foundation, aims to determine its special aspects, and thereby offer a couple of suggestions. In this research, descriptive-analytical method has been applied. The article has observed that through this project the pre-primary education is advancing in the rural underdeveloped regions. there is, however, a need to take some active steps which would render the project more operative and functional.</p>

      <p class="mt-3">The goal is to build a community of Muslims who are not only memorizers of the Qur’ān, but also memorizers who have perfected its recitation. The program is accessible to all regardless of age, ability, and previous reading level. All the teachers are specialized and taught Tajweed (articulation rulings on how to read the Quran). For beginners, we do have Qaida An-Nooraniya curriculum where we teach our students the qur’anic alphabets and the movements.  </p>
